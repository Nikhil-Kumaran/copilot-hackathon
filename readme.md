## Challenges I ran into üíª
- Authentication 

## Accomplishments that we are proud of üèÜ
This is the **First Time** we were using **Strapi** and with the use of GitHub Copilot we were able to code faster than we could and finish a complete web application.

## What we learnt üìö
We learnt many new things like Strapi, and a few unknown factors about React making every second we spent on this hackathon fully worthwhile.

## What's next for FinSense:
Up-next is to develop this application with more advanced features and functionalities to help financially take control of their expenses and keep track of it.
