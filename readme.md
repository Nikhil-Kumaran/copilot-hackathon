## How GitHub Copilot helped us in this project?

1. Increased Productivity
2. Improved Code Quality
3. Faster Prototyping than we expected
4. Eases Learning
5. Error handling and exception handling was absolutely doing good
6. Code Refactoring
7. GitHub Copilot Labs Extension in Visual Studio Code was extensively useful in Fixing Bugs and improved readability

## Challenges we ran into üíª

- Setting up an environment/playground to build was difficult at the beginning.
- Fixing bugs and managing code from local to cloud was taking was challenging.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of üèÜ

This is the **First Time** we were using **Strapi** and with the use of GitHub Copilot we were able to code faster than we could and finish a complete web application.

## What we learnt üìö

- We learnt many new things like Strapi, and a few unknown factors about React making every second we spent on this hackathon fully worthwhile.
- Efficiently use GitHub Copilot.

## What's next for FinSense:

Up-next is to develop this application with more advanced features and functionalities and add more statistic visualisations.
